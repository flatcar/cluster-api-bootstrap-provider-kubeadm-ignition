# Maintainers

See [Governance](https://github.com/flatcar/cluster-api-bootstrap-provider-kubeadm-ignition/blob/main/governance.md) for governance, commit, and vote guidelines as well as maintainer responsibilities.
Maintainership is managed in the github team [ClusterAPI Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/flatcar/teams/clusterapi-maintainers).
Every member of that team is a maintainer as per the governance definition referenced above.
