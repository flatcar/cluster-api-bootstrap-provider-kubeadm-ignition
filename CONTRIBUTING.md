Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! ðŸ’–

our project that we need help with including:

* Problems found during setting up a new developer environment

* Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a bug report and let us know!

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request.
Please join our [meetings](### Fortnightly Sync) or [file an issue](https://github.com/flatcar/cluster-api-bootstrap-provider-kubeadm-ignition/issues) and let's discuss how we can work
together. 

### Fortnightly Sync

The Node Bootstrapping working group of the Kubernetes SIG's ClusterAPI project meets every first and third Thursday of the month.
